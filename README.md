Library of wrapper functions in Python for Google APIs

Problem - 
As a developer, I wanted to learn about using Google APIs using Python. So, I started Googling about how to use APIs  and when I read some of the tutorials, it came to me that using those APIs are a bit complicated and one needs some patience and time to go through all those stuff. 

Solution - 
And, then I decided to  make life easier by defining some wrapper functions which will handle all those problems that one can come across.
Here, you can/will find those wrapper functions which can be used for developing those application which needs help of Google APIs.

Current status - 
Right now, I am working on the big picture (i.e. whole library/module distribution and layering) and some help from you guys would be thankfull.
